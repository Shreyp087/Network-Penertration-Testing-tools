# Detailed Documentation on Using SQLMap for Network Penetration Testing

SQLMap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It is a widely used tool for security assessments and network penetration testing. This documentation will guide you through using SQLMap effectively for network penetration testing.

## Installation

SQLMap is a Python-based tool that can be run on multiple platforms. Here are the general installation steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Download the latest SQLMap release from the official GitHub repository: [SQLMap GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap).

3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the SQLMap directory.

5. You can run SQLMap using the following command:

```bash
python sqlmap.py
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Target Selection

- To perform a basic scan with SQLMap, you need to specify a target URL. Use the `-u` option to provide the URL of the target web application:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url>
```

Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the web application you want to test.

### 2. Testing for SQL Injection

- SQLMap will automatically test the target URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities. It will try various techniques and payloads to identify potential vulnerabilities. To start the scan, use the following command:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url> --dbs
```

The `--dbs` option is used to instruct SQLMap to enumerate the available databases once it identifies a vulnerability.

### 3. Viewing Results

- SQLMap will display the progress of the scan in your terminal. Once it identifies vulnerabilities, it will list the databases, tables, and other relevant information. You can view this information in the terminal output.

### 4. Exploiting Vulnerabilities

- If SQLMap identifies a vulnerability and you want to exploit it, you can use the `--dump` option to retrieve data from the database. For example:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url> --dbs --batch --dump
```

The `--batch` option is used to automatically choose default options, and `--dump` is used to retrieve data.

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Specifying HTTP Request Method

- By default, SQLMap uses GET requests. You can specify the HTTP request method using the `-m` option. For example, to use POST requests:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url> -m POST --data="param1=value1&param2=value2"
```

Specify the POST data using the `--data` option.

### 2. Custom Headers

- You can include custom HTTP headers using the `--headers` option. For example:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url> --headers="User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0"
```

### 3. Cookie-Based Sessions

- If the target web application requires authentication, you can specify cookies using the `--cookie` option:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u <target_url> --cookie="PHPSESSID=abcdef123456"
```

### 4. Extensive Testing

- SQLMap provides various options to fine-tune the testing process. For example, you can specify specific database management systems to target, adjust the level of risk, or use custom scripts.

### 5. Output to Files

- You can save scan results and other information to files using the `-o` and `--log-file` options.

## Conclusion

SQLMap is a powerful tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. This documentation provides an overview of its capabilities, from basic scans to advanced customization options. Always use SQLMap responsibly and ensure that you have explicit authorization to conduct network penetration tests, as unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
