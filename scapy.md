# Detailed Documentation on Using Scapy for Network Penetration Testing

Scapy is a powerful Python library that allows you to create, manipulate, and send network packets. It is a versatile tool for network penetration testing, including packet crafting, sniffing, and protocol analysis. This documentation will guide you through using Scapy effectively for network penetration testing.

## Installation

Scapy is a Python library and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

Once installed, you can use Scapy in your Python scripts and interact with it from the Python shell.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Creating a Basic Packet

- To create a basic packet using Scapy, you can use the following code snippet in a Python script:

```python
from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, send

packet = IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP()
send(packet)
```

This code creates an ICMP echo request packet with the destination IP address of "192.168.1.1" and sends it.

### 2. Packet Sniffing

- Scapy can be used to sniff network packets. To sniff packets on a network interface, use the following code:

```python
from scapy.all import sniff

packets = sniff(iface="eth0", count=10)
```

This code will capture the next 10 packets on the "eth0" interface.

### 3. Sending Custom Packets

- Scapy allows you to send custom packets by specifying the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and other packet attributes.

```python
from scapy.all import IP, TCP, send

packet = IP(src="192.168.1.2", dst="192.168.1.3")/TCP(sport=1234, dport=80)
send(packet)
```

This code sends a custom TCP packet with a specified source IP, destination IP, source port, and destination port.

### 4. ICMP Ping

- You can use Scapy to send ICMP ping requests. Here's an example:

```python
from scapy.all import IP, ICMP, sr1

packet = IP(dst="192.168.1.1")/ICMP()
response = sr1(packet)
response.show()
```

This code sends an ICMP echo request to "192.168.1.1" and captures the response.

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Packet Crafting

- Scapy provides extensive packet crafting capabilities. You can create custom packets for various protocols and scenarios, including ARP, DNS, HTTP, and more.

### 2. Protocol Analysis

- Scapy can analyze network protocols and dissect packets. For example, you can analyze the structure of captured packets or dissect a packet in real-time.

### 3. Custom Sniffing and Filtering

- You can create custom packet sniffing and filtering functions to capture specific packets based on criteria you define.

### 4. Send and Receive Functions

- Scapy offers flexible functions for sending and receiving packets. You can use `send()` to send packets and `sr()` to send and receive packets.

### 5. Integration with Other Tools

- Scapy can be integrated with other network penetration testing tools and libraries. For example, you can use it in combination with Nmap or Wireshark for more advanced testing and analysis.

## Conclusion

Scapy is a versatile Python library for network penetration testing, offering extensive capabilities for packet crafting, sniffing, protocol analysis, and more. Always use Scapy responsibly and ensure that you have explicit authorization to conduct network penetration tests, as unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
