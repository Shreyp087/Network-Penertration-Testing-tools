# Detailed Documentation on Using Nikto for Network Penetration Testing

Nikto is an open-source web server scanner used for identifying security vulnerabilities on web servers. It's a valuable tool for network penetration testing and security assessments. This documentation will guide you through using Nikto effectively for network penetration testing.

## Installation

Nikto is typically pre-installed on many Linux distributions. If it's not already installed, you can download it from the official website or use a package manager to install it.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install nikto
```

### Linux (Red Hat/CentOS):

```bash
sudo yum install nikto
```

### macOS:

You can use Homebrew to install Nikto:

```bash
brew install nikto
```

### Windows:

For Windows, you can download the Windows version of Nikto from the official website: [Nikto Download Page](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)

## Basic Usage

### 1. Scanning a Web Server

- To perform a basic scan of a web server using Nikto, use the following command:

```bash
nikto -h <target>
```

Replace `<target>` with the URL or IP address of the web server you want to scan.

### 2. Viewing Scan Results

- Nikto will display the results of the scan in your terminal. The output includes identified vulnerabilities, security issues, and suggestions for remediation.

### 3. Saving Scan Results

- To save the scan results to a file, you can use the `-o` option followed by a filename:

```bash
nikto -h <target> -o scan_results.txt
```

This will save the results to a file named `scan_results.txt`.

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Customizing Scans

- Nikto allows you to customize scans using various options and plugins. For example, you can specify different ports, authentication credentials, and plugin configurations.

```bash
nikto -h <target> -p <port> -id <username>:<password> -evasion 1
```

In this example, we've set a custom port, provided authentication credentials, and enabled evasion techniques with the `-evasion` option.

### 2. Plugin Selection

- Nikto includes a wide range of plugins that can be used for specific tests. You can specify which plugins to use during a scan.

```bash
nikto -h <target> -Plugins <plugin1,plugin2,plugin3>
```

Replace `<plugin1,plugin2,plugin3>` with the names of the desired plugins.

### 3. Authentication

- If the web server requires authentication, you can provide credentials with the `-id` option.

```bash
nikto -h <target> -id <username>:<password>
```

Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with the appropriate credentials.

### 4. HTTP Method

- Nikto allows you to specify the HTTP method to use for requests. For example, you can use the `-method` option to set the HTTP method to POST.

```bash
nikto -h <target> -method POST
```

### 5. Scanning Multiple Targets

- You can scan multiple web servers by providing a text file with a list of target URLs or IP addresses.

```bash
nikto -h targets.txt
```

The `targets.txt` file should contain a list of targets, one per line.

## Conclusion

Nikto is a valuable tool for scanning web servers to identify vulnerabilities and security issues. This documentation provides an overview of its capabilities, from basic scans to advanced customization options. Always use Nikto responsibly and ensure you have explicit authorization to conduct network penetration tests, as unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
