### 2. Intruder

- The Intruder tool allows you to automate attacks on web applications using various payloads. It can be used to discover vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or weak authentication.

- To use Intruder, capture a request in the Proxy tab, then right-click the request and select "Send to Intruder."

### 3. Repeater

- Repeater is a tool for manually testing and modifying individual requests. Capture a request in the Proxy tab, right-click the request, and select "Send to Repeater."

- In Repeater, you can modify the request and observe the response.

### 4. Burp Extender

- Burp Extender allows you to add your own custom extensions to Burp Suite. This is useful for automating tasks or adding new features.

- You can write your extensions in Java or use existing extensions available in the BApp Store.

### 5. Collaborator

- Burp Collaborator is a service that helps discover out-of-band vulnerabilities. It can be used to test for SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) and other related vulnerabilities.

- To use Collaborator, go to the Burp Collaborator Client in the Burp Suite menu.

### 6. Logging and Reporting

- Burp Suite allows you to log all traffic and actions performed during testing. To enable logging, go to the "Project options" in the "Project" tab.
